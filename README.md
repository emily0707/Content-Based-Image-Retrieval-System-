How to use your system with
step-by-step instructions:


After
open the system, you can use “previous page” and “next page” to select the
target picture for a query. 
All
the 100 images are preprocessed and results are stored in text file. After you click
the “Search by Intensity” or “Search by Color Code” button, you will to get the
query result immediately without waiting. 
After
you are done, you can either click “Reset” button to reset the system to the
original state, or you can click close icon on the right corner to close
the system. 
If
one user updates some images in database, then he/she needs to click
“preprocess” button to update data before start a query. It will take about 5-10
minutes to process. Because we need to generate intensity, colorcode data and
search result indexes for each picture. 
It involves a lot of calculation.
